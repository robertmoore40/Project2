# Rising Tide Reviews

Rising Tide is an app which allows users to up/down boat content, for an organic scoring system which is more implicit than a rating based on an arbitrary number (5/10, 7.4/10), etc. 

First, Movies will be searched and added to a database of available movies to "upboat" or "downboat". We show a maximum of five movies at a time for unique users to vote upon. The data in the database can be sorted by a variety of choices, including most recent, most popular, etc.

Upon completetion of the movie aspect of the website, it is to be extended into books, tv shows, and music.
